## Exercise I

a) this will run forever, except in the case that n = 0. then it is constant.

If n is a size of input, it must be >= 0.
So, n^3 will be >= 0 (call it z)
So, a will always (except in one edge case, where n = 0) be less than z.



b) O(n) = 2 
   Except in edge case: n == 0, where order is O(1)
   The outer for loop is O(n)
   Within that, the loop up to n is O(n).
   So, an O(n) running O(n) times.
  
   


c) O(n) = n^n

Hard problem.

In the edge case (n = 0) it is constant.

Above that, it gets exp-exponentially more complex as it gets expoentially more complex.
